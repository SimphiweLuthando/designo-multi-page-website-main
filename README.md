## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Your Message` fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
- **Bonus**: View actual locations on the locations page maps (we recommend [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) for this)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS


### What I learned

This was quite a big project. 7 Pages! Definitely a good reminder as to why code reusability is so important. I really saw it as alot of the components were similar on each page. This project helped me master using utility classes to style common elements instead of reinventing the wheel each time.


### Continued development

Given how heavy the UI interaction is on this site I definitely could have built it using REACT as that would make for a much more seamless user interaction and faster loading times as well. I also could have lazy loaded the images to improve the site's speed too.
